Web designers didn’t so much lead the way into minimalist nav design approaches as were pushed into it because of mobile design requirements. One result is that websites viewed on desktops have over time become much easier to navigate.

It’s something like trying to shorten sentences when writing, where you find you can convey as much information in fewer words and even do it better.

In the case of mobile navigation, it’s a matter of working with fewer links and less allowable space. Designers addressed the issue by limiting the number of pages in the primary menu and relegating links to sidebars or footers.

The result? An equally effective but much cleaner design.
